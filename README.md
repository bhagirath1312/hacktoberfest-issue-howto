# hacktoberfest-issue-howto
Best practices for creating issues that encourage people to give useful PRs in response. Because Hacktoberfest is a unique time of year that brings new folks to open source repositories, special care should be given to minimize confusion and frustration in issue creation.

This repo will contain tips for two sets of folks: Repo owners that create issues, and Hacktoberfest participants that want to use the allure of a comfy free t-shirt to try out contributing to open source.

## Making a good Hacktoberfest issue:
The secret to getting pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants is trying to put yourself in the shoes of a first time contributor.
_A first-time contributor may have some of these chartacteristics:_
* This may be their first time using Github, or their first time using source control out of a work or school context.
* They have zero to many years of experience in this programming language.
* They may have previously worked on projects alone or in very small groups, always starting from the beginning of the project.
* They have limited free time, and are using Hacktoberfest as a trial run in spending free time working on open source code.
* They like free t-shirts and stickers.

Keeping aware of these characteristics, we want to have as little friction as possible between creating an issue, having a stranger read that issue, decide to work on the project, bring down your repo and get it to run, make the needed changes, and  

### Introduce the part of the program that needs attention and how it works in general.
If someone has never seen your repo before, they probably don't know how your stuff works.  Help them out. Give a general overview of what is currently happening in the application.

### Define the problem or enhancement you want.
Make a permalink to the line numbers, or refer to particular parts of code that are relevant.  Here is how to create a permalink to a line or lines of code that can be used inside of an issue: https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet
You can do the normal user story stuff here. Example: As a _someone_, I want _a thing_ so that I can _do something_.

### Give suggestions on a possible path to pursue to accomplish the task.
Consider giving some architectural advice on the sort of change you're looking to see.
