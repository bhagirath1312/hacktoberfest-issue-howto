# hacktoberfest-issue-howto
Best practices for creating issues that encourage people to give useful PRs in response. Because Hacktoberfest is a unique time of year that brings new folks to open source repositories, special care should be given to minimize confusion and frustration in issue creation.

This repo will contain tips for two sets of folks: Repo owners that create issues, and Hacktoberfest participants that want to use the allure of a comfy free t-shirt to try out contributing to open source.

TODO: Actually provide advice.
